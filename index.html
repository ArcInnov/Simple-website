<!-- You could build a website by including all of your HTML, CSS styles, and JavaScript code within a single file. However, in this exercise you're using an HTML file for your content, a CSS file for your styling, and a JavaScript file for your interactivity.

Setting up three files helps keep your website project organized.

<!-- The meta tag indicates metadata information that won't typically be visible to the viewer unless they view the source code in their browser. Meta elements or tags provide descriptive information about the webpage. For example, they help search engines process which information in your webpages to return in search results.

The character set (charset) for UTF-8 may seem insignificant, but is crucial for establishing how computers interpret characters. If the metadata for the character set is missing, that can lead to compromised security.  -->

    The Elements tab in developer tools shows you the document object model (DOM) as rendered in the browser. When debugging, it's often important to see how the browser interprets your source code.
    Inspecting the page in a browser provides all sorts of useful information and can help you troubleshoot problems. You can also view CSS details with the inspector
